JS-YAML - YAML 1.2 parser and serializer for JavaScript
=======================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nodeca/js-yaml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nodeca/js-yaml)
[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/js-yaml.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/js-yaml)

[Online Demo](http://nodeca.github.com/js-yaml/)


This is an implementation of [YAML](http://yaml.org/), a human friendly data
serialization language. Started as [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/) port, it was
completely rewritten from scratch. Now it's very fast, and supports 1.2 spec.


Installation
------------

### YAML module for node.js

```
npm install js-yaml
```


### CLI executable

If you want to inspect your YAML files from CLI, install js-yaml globally:

```
npm install -g js-yaml
```

#### Usage

```
usage: js-yaml [-h] [-v] [-c] [-t] file

Positional arguments:
  file           File with YAML document(s)

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help     Show this help message and exit.
  -v, --version  Show program's version number and exit.
  -c, --compact  Display errors in compact mode
  -t, --trace    Show stack trace on error
```


### Bundled YAML library for browsers

``` html
<!-- esprima required only for !!js/function -->
<script src="esprima.js"></script>
<script src="js-yaml.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
var doc = jsyaml.load('greeting: hello\nname: world');
</script>
```

Browser support was done mostly for online demo. If you find any errors - feel
free to send pull requests with fixes. Also note, that IE and other old browsers
needs [es5-shims](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim) to operate.

Notes:

1. We have no resourses to support browserified version. Don't expect it to be
   well tested. Don't expect fast fixes if something goes wrong there.
2. `!!js/function` in browser bundle will not work by default. If you really need
   it - load `esprima` parser first (via amd or directly).
3. `!!bin` in browser will return `Array`, because browsers do not support
   node.js `Buffer` and adding Buffer shims is completely useless on practice.


API
---

Here we cover the most 'useful' methods. If you need advanced details (creating
your own tags), see [wiki](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/wiki) and
[examples](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/tree/master/examples) for more
info.

``` javascript
yaml = require('js-yaml');
fs   = require('fs');

// Get document, or throw exception on error
try {
  var doc = yaml.safeLoad(fs.readFileSync('/home/ixti/example.yml', 'utf8'));
  console.log(doc);
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```


### safeLoad (string [ , options ])

**Recommended loading way.** Parses `string` as single YAML document. Returns a JavaScript
object or throws `YAMLException` on error. By default, does not support regexps,
functions and undefined. This method is safe for untrusted data.

options:

- `filename` _(default: null)_ - string to be used as a file path in
  error/warning messages.
- `onWarning` _(default: null)_ - function to call on warning messages.
  Loader will throw on warnings if this function is not provided.
- `schema` _(default: `DEFAULT_SAFE_SCHEMA`)_ - specifies a schema to use.
  - `FAILSAFE_SCHEMA` - only strings, arrays and plain objects:
    http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2802346
  - `JSON_SCHEMA` - all JSON-supported types:
    http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2803231
  - `CORE_SCHEMA` - same as `JSON_SCHEMA`:
    http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2804923
  - `DEFAULT_SAFE_SCHEMA` - all supported YAML types, without unsafe ones
    (`!!js/undefined`, `!!js/regexp` and `!!js/function`):
    http://yaml.org/type/
  - `DEFAULT_FULL_SCHEMA` - all supported YAML types.

NOTE: This function **does not** understand multi-document sources, it throws
exception on those.

NOTE: JS-YAML **does not** support schema-specific tag resolution restrictions.
So, JSON schema is not as strict as defined in the YAML specification.
It allows numbers in any notaion, use `Null` and `NULL` as `null`, etc.
Core schema also has no such
