optimist
========

Optimist is a node.js library for option parsing for people who hate option
parsing. More specifically, this module is for people who like all the --bells
and -whistlz of program usage but think optstrings are a waste of time.

With optimist, option parsing doesn't have to suck (as much).

With Optimist, the options are just a hash! No optstrings attached.
