# Change Log

## 0.1.43

* Performance improvements for `SourceMapGenerator` and `SourceNode`. See issue
  #148 for some discussion and issues #150, #151, and #152 for implementations.

## 0.1.42

* Fix an issue where `SourceNode`s from different versions of the source-map
  library couldn't be used in conjunction with each other. See issue #142.

## 0.1.41

* Fix a bug with getting the source content of relative sources with a "./"
  prefix. See issue #145 and [Bug 1090768](bugzil.la/1090768).

* Add the `SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans` method to compute the
  column span of each mapping.

* Add the `SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor` method to find
  all generated positions associated with a given original source and line.

## 0.1.40

* Performance improvements for parsing source maps in SourceMapConsumer.

## 0.1.39

* Fix a bug where setting a source's contents to null before any source content
  had been set before threw a TypeError. See issue #131.

## 0.1.38

* Fix a bug where finding relative paths from an empty path were creating
  absolute paths. See issue #129.

## 0.1.37

* Fix a bug where if the source root was an empty string, relative source paths
  would turn into absolute source paths. Issue #124.

## 0.1.36

* Allow the `names` mapping property to be an empty string. Issue #121.

## 0.1.35

* A third optional parameter was added to `SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap`
  to specify a path that relative sources in the second parameter should be
  relative to. Issue #105.

* If no file property is given to a `SourceMapGenerator`, then the resulting
  source map will no longer have a `null` file property. The property will
  simply not exist. Issue #104.

* Fixed a bug where consecutive newlines were ignored in `SourceNode`s.
  Issue #116.

## 0.1.34

* Make `SourceNode` work with windows style ("\r\n") newlines. Issue #103.

* Fix bug involving source contents and the
  `SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap`. Issue #100.

## 0.1.33

* Fix some edge cases surrounding path joining and URL resolution.

* Add a third parameter for relative path to
  `SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap`.

* Fix issues with mappings and EOLs.

## 0.1.32

* Fixed a bug where SourceMapConsumer couldn't handle negative relative columns
  (issue 92).

* Fixed test runner to actually report number of failed tests as its process
  exit code.

* Fixed a typo when reporting bad mappings (issue 87).

## 0.1.31

* Delay parsing the mappings in SourceMapConsumer until queried for a s
