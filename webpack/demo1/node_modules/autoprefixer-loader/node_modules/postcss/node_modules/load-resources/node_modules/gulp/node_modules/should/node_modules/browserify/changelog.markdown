# 11.0.0

## streams3

The [`readable-stream`](https://npmjs.com/package/readable-stream) dependency was updated to `^2.0.0`. This package is inserted into bundles as `require('stream')`. Bundles will now get the latest streams implementation from io.js/node.js core, instead of an old version from node.js 0.11.x. Go forth and stream ALL THE DATA without fear!

## shiny new HTTP package

[John Hiesey](https://github.com/jhiesey) rewrote the [http-browserify](https://npmjs.org/package/http-browserify) package
to create [stream-http](https://npmjs.org/package/stream-http), an implemention of `http` that supports streaming in modern browsers. Before v11.0.0, in most situations when you used `http.get` or `http.request`, the entire request would buffer in memory until the download was complete, and a single `'data'` event was emitted with the entire response as a string.

`stream-http` uses the [Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) and various browser-specific XHR extensions to make binary streaming http requests work in as many browsers as possible.

The following browsers support true streaming, where only a small amount of the request has to be held in memory at once:

* Chrome >= 43 (using the `fetch` api)
* Firefox >= 9 (using `moz-chunked-arraybuffer` responseType with XHR)

The following browsers support pseudo-streaming, where the data is available before the request finishes, but the entire response must be held in memory:

* Safari >= 5
* IE >= 10
* Most other Webkit-based browsers, including the default Android browser

Older browsers will work, without streaming support. There is no support for IE6 or IE7.

Compared to `http-browserify`, it is not necessary to set `options.responseType`. The `responseType` property of the XHR object will be set automatically depending on what features are detected in the browser (although see `options.mode` in the [readme](https://github.com/jhiesey/stream-http) to see how you can optimize this choice manually).

The `response` is a streams3 stream, so all data is passed as `Buffer`s, unlike the variable types provided by the `'data'` event in `http-browserify`. This behavior tries to mimic the node core `http` module as closely as possible.

https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/pull/1248

# 10.1.0

adds `--no-browser-field` and `opts.browserField = false` behavior to turn off
the package.json browser field. This is useful if you want to make a bundle with
a target of node or some environment with shimmed node primitives.

A new alias `--node` sets `--no-browser-field` and `--bare`.

# 10.0.0

## Possibly Breaking Change
The ‘process’ dependency was updated to ~0.11.0, this module is inserted into bundles as the ‘process’ global/dependency.
Previously, an unhandled error thrown in a ‘process.nextTick’ task would prevent any subsequent tasks from running, forever.
The task queue now recovers from this condition, but may do so on a future browser tick.
As part of this update, ‘process.nextTick’ now accepts variadic arguments, passed to the task, added to io.js in 1.8.1.

and some fixes to regressions involving the `'package'` event:

https://github.com/substack/node-resolve/issues/69

Upstream changes in resolve/browser-resolve mean that `require('foo/bar')` works
better with the package.json browser field. You can do something like:

``` json

https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/951

# 8.0.0

In previous releases, the deduping logic was over-zealous about how it handled
module references for duplicates. The prior behavior would detect when the
dependency tree of a module matched an existing module in addition to having the
exact same source code to share an instance. This was originally designed to
support libraries like threejs that internally use `instanceof` checks that
don't usually work very well across multiple packages. This feature didn't pan
out and didn't work very well in practice.

Later, a better way of deduping emerged after some unrelated tweaks to
browser-pack to support source introspection for webworkers. The reflection form
of deduping using implicit arguments is now the only kind.

The deduping instance feature resulted in this bug:
https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/1027
which created very surprising results when duplicate files were in use.

fixes rebundling (used by watchify) when transforming

https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/1012

also fixes https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/1015

# 7.0.0

Global transforms are now resolved to an absolute path before walking files.
This fixes some bugs with local module versions taking precedence over global
transforms and unresolvable global transforms spanning system directories.

This is a small breaking change since now transform objects live in the pipeline
between the record and deps phases. This should only affect programs that expect
records in the pipeline to only contain file objects.
