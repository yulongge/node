/**
 * utility methods to process coverage objects. A coverage object has the following
 * format.
 *
 *      {
 *          "/path/to/file1.js": { file1 coverage },
 *          "/path/to/file2.js": { file2 coverage }
 *      }
 *
 *  The internals of the file coverage object are intentionally not documented since
 *  it is not a public interface.
 *
 *  *Note:* When a method of this module has the word `File` in it, it will accept
 *  one of the sub-objects of the main coverage object as an argument. Other
 *  methods accept the higher level coverage object with multiple keys.
 *
 * Works on `node` as well as the browser.
 *
 * Usage on nodejs
 * ---------------
 *
 *      var objectUtils = require('istanbul').utils;
 *
 * Usage in a browser
 * ------------------
 *
 * Load this file using a `script` tag or other means. This will set `window.coverageUtils`
