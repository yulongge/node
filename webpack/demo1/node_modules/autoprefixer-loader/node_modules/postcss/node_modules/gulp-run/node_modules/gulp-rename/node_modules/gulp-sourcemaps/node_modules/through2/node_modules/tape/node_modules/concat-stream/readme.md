# concat-stream

Writable stream that concatenates strings or binary data and calls a callback with the result. Not a transform stream -- more of a stream sink.

### description

Streams emit many buffers. If you want to collect all of the buffers, and when the stream ends concatenate all of the buffers together and receive a single buffer then this is the module for you.

Only use this if you know you can fit all of the output of your stream into a single Buffer (e.g. in RAM).

There are also `objectMode` streams that emit things other than Buffers, and you can concatenate these too. See below for details.

### examples

#### Buffers

```js
var fs = require('fs')
var concat = require('concat-stream')

var readStream = fs.createReadStream('cat.png')
var concatStream = concat(gotPicture)

readStream.on('error', handleError)
readStream.pipe(concatStream)

function gotPicture(imageBuffer) {
  // imageBuffer is all of `cat.png` as a node.js Buffer
}

function handleError(err) {
  // handle your error appropriately here, e.g.:
  console.error(err) // print the error to STDERR
  process.exit(1) // exit program with non-zero exit code
}

```

#### Arrays

```js
var write = concat(function(data) {})
write.write([1,2,3])
write.write([4,5,6])
write.end()
// data will be [1,2,3,4,5,6] in the above callback
```

#### Uint8Arrays

```js
var write = concat(function(data) {})
var a = new Uint8Array(3)
a[0] = 97; a[1] = 98; a[2] = 99
write.write(a)
write.write('!')
write.end(Buffer('!!1'))
```

See `test/` for more examples

# methods

```js
var concat = require('concat-stream')
```

## var writable = concat(opts={}, cb)

Return a `writable` stream that will fire `cb(data)` with all of the data that
was written to the stream. Data can be written to `writable` as strings,
Buffers, arrays of byte integers, and Uint8Arr
