# StreamSpec

Automatic checking of the Stream implementations.
`stream-spec` instruments your stream to verify that it has correct behaviour.
All you need to do to test a stream is to wrap it with `stream-spec`, and then pipe
some test data through it.
it's purpose it to make it easy to test user-land streams have correct behavour.
