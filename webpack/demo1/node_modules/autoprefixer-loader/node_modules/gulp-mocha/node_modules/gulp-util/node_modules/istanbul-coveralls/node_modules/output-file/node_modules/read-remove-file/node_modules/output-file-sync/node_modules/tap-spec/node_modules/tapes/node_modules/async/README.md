# Async.js

[![Build Status via Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/caolan/async.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caolan/async)


Async is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions
for working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for
use with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and installable via `npm install async`,
it can also be used directly in the browser.

Async is also installable via:

- [bower](http://bower.io/): `bower install async`
- [component](https://github.com/component/component): `component install
  caolan/async`
- [jam](http://jamjs.org/): `jam install async`
- [spm](http://spmjs.io/): `spm install async`

Async provides around 20 functions that include the usual 'functional'
suspects (`map`, `reduce`, `filter`, `each`…) as well as some common patterns
for asynchronous control flow (`parallel`, `series`, `waterfall`…). All these
functions assume you follow the Node.js convention of providing a single
callback as the last argument of your `async` function.


## Quick Examples

```javascript
async.map(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.stat, function(err, results){
    // results is now an array of stats for each file
});

async.filter(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.exists, function(results){
    // results now equals an array of the existing files
});

async.parallel([
    function(){ ... },
    function(){ ... }
], callback);

async.series([
    function(){ ... },
    function(){ ... }
]);
```

There are many more functions available so take a look at the docs below for a
full list. This module aims to be comprehensive, so if you feel anything is
missing please create a GitHub issue for it.

## Common Pitfalls

### Binding a context to an iterator

This section is really about `bind`, not about `async`. If you are wondering how to
make `async` execute your iterators in a given context, or are confused as to why
a method of another library isn't working as an iterator, study this example:

```js
// Here is a simple object with an (unnecessarily roundabout) squaring method
var AsyncSquaringLibrary = {
  squareExponent: 2,
  square: function(number, callback){ 
    var result = Math.pow(number, this.squareExponent);
    setTimeout(function(){
      callback(null, result);
    }, 200);
  }
};

async.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square, function(err, result){
  // result is [NaN, NaN, NaN]
  // This fails because the `this.squareExponent` expression in the square
  // function is not evaluated in the context of AsyncSquaringLibrary, and is
  // therefore undefined.
});

async.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square.bind(AsyncSquaringLibrary), function(err, result){
  // result is [1, 4, 9]
  // With the help of bind we can attach a context to the iterator before
  // passing it to async. Now the square function will be executed in its 
  // 'home' AsyncSquaringLibrary context and the value of `this.squareExponent`
  // will be as expected.
});
```

## Download

The source is available for download from
[GitHub](http://github.com/caolan/async).
Alternatively, you can install using Node Package Manager (`npm`):

    npm install async

## In the Browser

So far it's been tested in IE6, IE7, IE8, FF3.6 and Chrome 5. 

Usage:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="async.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">

    async.map(data, asyncProcess, function(err, results){
        alert(results);
    });

</script>
```
