# JavaScript Standard Style

Right now, the best way to learn about `standard` is to just install it and give it a try
on your code. Over time, we hope to enumerate all the rules here. So far, only the most
important rules are listed here. Please send PRs!

## High-Level Rules

- **2 spaces** – for indentation
- **Single quotes for strings** – except to avoid escaping
- **No unused variables** – this one catches *tons* of bugs!
- **No semicolons** – [It's][1] [fine.][2] [Really!][3]
- **Never start a line with `(` or `[`**
    - This is the **only** gotcha with omitting semicolons – *automatically checked for you!*
- **Space after keywords** `if (condition) { ... }`
- **Space after function name** `function name (arg) { ... }`
- Always use `===` instead of `==` – but `obj == null` is allowed to check `null || undefined`.
- Always handle the node.js `err` function parameter
- Always prefix browser globals with `window` – except `document` and `navigator` are okay
  - Prevents accidental use of poorly-named browser globals like `open`, `length`,
    `event`, and `name`.

## Automatic semicolon insertion (ASI)

*Quoting from ["An Open Letter to JavaScript Leaders Regarding Semicolons"][1]:*

[Relying on automatic semicolon insertion] is quite safe, and perfectly valid JS that every browser understands. Closure compiler, yuicompressor, packer, and jsmin all can properly minify it. There is no performance impact anywhere.

I am sorry that, instead of educating you, the leaders in this language communit
