# normalize-package-data [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/meryn/normalize-package-data.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/meryn/normalize-package-data)

normalize-package data exports a function that normalizes package metadata. This data is typically found in a package.json file, but in principle could come from any source - for example the npm registry.

normalize-package-data is used by [read-package-json](https://npmjs.org/package/read-package-json) to normalize the data it reads from a package.json file. In turn, read-package-json is used by [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/npm) and various npm-related tools.

## Installation

```
npm install normalize-package-data
```

## Usage

Basic usage is really simple. You call the function that normalize-package-data exports. Let's call it `normalizeData`.

```javascript
normalizeData = require('normalize-package-data')
packageData = fs.readFileSync("package.json")
normalizeData(packageData)
// packageData is now normalized
```
