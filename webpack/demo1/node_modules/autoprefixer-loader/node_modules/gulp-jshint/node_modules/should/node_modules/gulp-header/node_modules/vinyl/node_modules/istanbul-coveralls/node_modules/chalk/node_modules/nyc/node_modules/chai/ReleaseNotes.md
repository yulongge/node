## 2.3.0 / 2015-04-26

Added `ownPropertyDescriptor` assertion:

```js
expect('test').to.have.ownPropertyDescriptor('length');
expect('test').to.have.ownPropertyDescriptor('length', { enumerable: false, configurable: false, writable: false, value: 4 });
expect('test').not.to.have.ownPropertyDescriptor('length', { enumerable: false, configurable: false, writable: false, value: 3 });
expect('test').ownPropertyDescriptor('length').to.have.property('enumerable', false);
expect('test').ownPropertyDescriptor('length').to.have.keys('value');
```

## 2.1.0 / 2015-02-23

Small release; fixes an issue where the Chai lib was incorrectly reporting the
version number.

Adds new `should.fail()` and `expect.fail()` methods, which are convinience
methods to throw Assertion Errors.

## 2.0.0 / 2015-02-09

Unfortunately with 1.10.0 - compatibility broke with older versions because of
the `addChainableNoop`. This change has been reverted.

Any plugins using `addChainableNoop` should cease to do so.

Any developers wishing for this behaviour can use [dirty-chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dirty-chai)

## 1.10.0 / 2014-11-10

The following changes are required if you are upgrading from the previous version:

- **Users:**
  - No changes required
- **Plugin Developers:**
  - Review `addChainableNoop` notes below.
- **Core Contributors:**
  - Refresh `node_modules` folder for updated dependencies.

### Noop Function for Terminating Assertion Properties

The following assertions can now also be used in the function-call form:

* ok
* true
* false
* null
* undefined
* exist
* empty
* arguments
* Arguments

The above list of assertions are property getters that assert immediately on
access. Because of that, they were written to be used by terminating the assertion
chain with a property access.

```js
expect(true).to.be.true;
foo.should.be.ok;
```

This syntax is definitely aesthetically pleasing but, if you are linting your
test code, your linter will complain with an error something like "Expected an
assignment or function call and instead saw an expression." Since the linter
doesn't know about the property getter it assumes this line has no side-effects,
and throws a warning in case you made a mistake.

Squelching these errors is not a good solution as test code is getting to be
just as important as, if not more than, production code. Catching syntactical
errors in tests using static analysis is a great tool to help make sure that your
tests are well-defined and free of typos.

A better option was to provide a function-call form for these assertions so that
the code's intent is more clear and the linters stop complaining about something
looking off. This form is added in addition to the existing property access form
and does not impact existing test code.

```js
expect(true).to.be.true();
foo.should.be.ok();
```

These forms can also be mixed in any way, these are all functionally identical:

```js
expect(true).to.be.true.and.not.false();
expect(true).to.be.true().and.not.false;
expect(true).to.be.true.and.not.false;
```

#### Plugin Authors

If you would like to provide this function-call form for your terminating assertion
properties, there is a new function to register these types of asserts. Instead
of using `addProperty` to register terminating assertions, simply use `addChainableNoop`
instead; the arguments to both are identical. The latter will make the assertion
available in both the attribute and function-call forms and should have no impact
on existing users of your plugin.

## 1.9.1 / 2014-03-19

The following changes are required if you are upgrading from the previous version:

- **Users:**
  - Migrate configuration options to new interface. (see notes)
- **Plugin Developers:**
  - No changes required
- **Core Contributors:**
  - Refresh `node_modules` folder for updated dependencies.

### Configuration

There have been requests for changes and additions to the configuration mechanisms
and their impact in the Chai architecture. As such, we have decoupled the
configuration from the `Assertion` constructor. Th
