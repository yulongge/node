How to contribute
=================

The best way to make sure your issue is addressed is to submit a patch. We accept
patches through all mediums: pull requests, email, issue comment, tweet with a link
to a snippet, graffiti outside of Anton's apartment, etc.

However, before sending a patch, please make sure that the following applies:

* Your commit message links to that issue.
* Your commit message is very descriptive ([example](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/commit/5751c5ed249b7a035758a3ae876cfa1a360fd144)).
* Your patch doesn't have useless merge commits.
* Your coding style is similar to ours (see below).
* Your patch is 100% tested. We don't accept any test regressions.
* All tests and lint checks pass (`node make.js test` and `node make.js lint`).
* You understand that we're super grateful for your patch.
