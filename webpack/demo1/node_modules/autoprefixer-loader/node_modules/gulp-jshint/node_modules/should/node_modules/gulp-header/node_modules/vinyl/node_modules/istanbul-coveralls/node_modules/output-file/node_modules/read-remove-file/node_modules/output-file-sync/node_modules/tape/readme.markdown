# example

``` js
var test = require('tape');

test('timing test', function (t) {
    t.plan(2);
    
    t.equal(typeof Date.now, 'function');
    var start = Date.now();
    
    setTimeout(function () {
        t.equal(Date.now() - start, 100);
    }, 100);
});
```

```
$ node example/timing.js
TAP version 13
# timing test
ok 1 should be equal
not ok 2 should be equal
  ---
    operator: equal
    expected: 100
    actual:   107
  ...

1..2
# tests 2
# pass  1
# fail  1
```

# usage

You always need to `require('tape')` in test files. You can run the tests by
usual node means (`require('test-file.js')` or `node test-file.js`). You can
also run tests using the `tape` binary to utilize globbing, on Windows for
example:

```sh
$ tape tests/**/*.js
```

`tape`'s arguments are passed to the
[`glob`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) module. If you want `glob` to
perform the expansion on a system where the shell performs such expansion, quote
the arguments as necessary:

```sh
$ tape 'tests/**/*.js'
$ tape "tests/**/*.js"
```

# things that go well with tape

tape maintains a fairly minimal core. Additional features are usually added by using another module alongside tape.

## pretty reporters

The default TAP output is good for machines and humans that are robots.

If you want a more colorful / pretty output there are lots of modules on npm
that will output something pretty if you pipe TAP into them:

 - https://github.com/scottcorgan/tap-spec
 - https://github.com/scottcorgan/tap-dot
 - https://github.com/substack/faucet
 - https://github.com/juliangruber/tap-bail
 - https://github.com/kirbysayshi/tap-browser-color
 - https://github.com/gummesson/tap-json
 - https://github.com/gummesson/tap-min
 - https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/tap-nyan
 - https://www.npmjs.org/package/tap-pessimist
 - https://github.com/toolness/tap-prettify
 - https://github.com/shuhei/colortape
 - https://github.com/aghassemi/tap-xunit
 - https://github.com/namuol/tap-difflet

To use them, try `node test/index.js | tap-spec` or pipe it into one
of the modules of your choice!

## uncaught exceptions

By default, uncaught exceptions in your tests will not be intercepted, and will cause tape to crash. If you find this behavior undesirable, use [tape-catch](https://github.com/michaelrhodes/tape-catch) to report any exceptions as TAP errors.

- CoffeeScript support with https://www.npmjs.com/package/coffeetape
- Promise support with https://www.npmjs.com/package/blue-tape

# methods

The assertion methods in tape are heavily influenced or copied from the methods
in [node-tap](https://github.com/isaacs/node-tap).

```
var test = require('tape')
```

## test([name], [opts], cb)

Create a new test with an optional `name` string and
