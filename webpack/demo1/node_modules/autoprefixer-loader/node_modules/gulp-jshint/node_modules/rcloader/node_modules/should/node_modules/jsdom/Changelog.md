## 5.6.1

* Fixed an accidentally-created global `attribute` variable if you ever called `createAttributeNS`.
* Dependency upgrades fixed a couple of bugs, although you would have gotten these anyway with a clean jsdom 5.6.0 install:
  - Parsing of CSS properties that use `url("quoted string")` now works correctly, as of cssstyle 0.2.29.
  - Selectors for the empty string, like `div[title=""]`, now work correctly, as of nwmatcher 1.3.6.

## 5.6.0

* `virtualConsole.sendTo` now returns `this`, allowing for [a nice shorthand](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/tree/60ccb9b318d0bae8fe37e19af5af444b9c98ddac#forward-a-windows-console-output-to-the-iojs-console). (jeffcarp)

## 5.5.0

* Added `postMessage` support, for communicating between parent windows, iframes, and combinations thereof. It's missing a few semantics, especially around origins, as well as MessageEvent source. Objects are not yet structured cloned, but instead passed by reference. But it's working, and awesome! (jeffcarp)
* Rewrote cloning code (underlying `cloneNode` and `importNode`), fixing a number of issues:
  - Elements with weird tag names, of the type that only the parser can normally create, can now be cloned ([#1142](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/1142))
  - Doctypes can now be cloned, per the latest spec.
  - Attrs cannot be cloned, per the latest spec (although they still have a `cloneNode` method for now due to legacy).
  - Document clones now correctly copy over the URL and content-type.
* Fixed any virtual console output from iframes to be proxied to the parent window's virtual console. (jeffcarp)
* Fixed the `type` property of `<button>` elements to correctly default to `submit`, and to stay within the allowed range.
* Fixed clicking on submit `<button>`s to submit their containing form; previously only `<input type="submit">` worked. (rxgx)
* Fixed `document.open()` to return `this`, per spec. (ryanseddon)

Additionally, Joris-van-der-Wel added [a benchmarking framework](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/blob/master/Contributing.md#running-the-benchmarks), and a number of benchmarks, which should help us avoid performance regressions going forward, and also make targeted performance fixes. We're already investigating [some real-world issues](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/1156) using this framework. Very exciting!

## 5.4.3

* Incorporated upstream fix for setting `el.style.cssText` to an invalid value, which should be ignored instead of causing an error to be thrown. This same bug has also caused an error while setting the style attribute to an invalid value, ever since 5.4.0. (Joris-van-der-Wel; chad3814 upstream)

## 5.4.2

* Fixed license metadata to conform to latest npm standards.

## 5.4.1

* Fixed to work with browserify again (regression introduced in 5.4.0).

## 5.4.0

This is a pretty exciting release! It includes a couple features I never really anticipated jsdom being awesome enough to have, but our wonderful contributors powered through and made them happen anyway:

* Added support for the default HTML stylesheet when using `window.getComputedStyle`! (akhaku)
  - Notably, this makes jQuery's `show()` and `hide()` methods now work correctly; see [#994](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/994).
* Added support for named properties on `window`: any elements with an `id` attribute, or certain elements with a `name` attribute, will cause properties to show up on the `window`, and thus as global variables within the jsdom. (Joris-van-der-Wel)
  - Although this is fairly unfortunate browser behavior, it's standardized and supported everywhere, so the fact that jsdom now supports this too means we can run a lot of scripts that would previously fail.
  - Previously, we only supported this for `<iframe>`s, and our implementation was quite buggy: e.g., `<iframe name="addEventListener">` would override `window.addEventListener`.
  - Now that we have the infrastructure in place, we anticipate expanding our support so that this works on e.g. `HTMLFormElement`s as well in the future.

We also have a bunch more fixes and additions:

* Implemented the [`NonDocumentTypeChildNode`](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#nondocumenttypechildnode) mixin. Practically, this means adding `nextElementSibling` and `previousElementSibling` to `Element` and the various types of `CharacterData`. (brandon-bethke-neudesic)
* Updated `StyleSheetList` to inherit from `Array`, as per the latest CSSOM spec.
* Overhauled the handling of attributes throughout the DOM, to follow the spec more exactly.
  - Our `NamedNodeMap` implementation is up to date, as are the various `Element` methods; other places in the code that deal with attributes now all go through a spec-compliant set of helpers.
  - Some weirdnesses around the `style` attribute were fixed along the way; see e.g. [#1109](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/1109).
  - However, `Attr` objects themselves are not yet spec-compliant (e.g., they still inherit from `Node`). That's coming soon.
* Fixed an unfortunate bug where `getElementById` would fail to work correctly on `<img>` elements whose `id` attributes were modified. (Joris-van-der-Wel)
* Fixed the `virtualConsole` option to work with `jsdom.env`, not just `jsdom.jsdom`. (jeffcarp)
* Removed a few functions that were erroneously added to `window`: `mapper`, `mapDOMNodes`, and `visitTree`. (Joris-van-der-Wel)

## 5.3.0

* Added a `virtualConsole` option to the document creation methods, along with the `jsdom.createVirtualConsole` factory. (See [examples in the readme](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/blob/dbf88666d1152576237ed1c741263f5516bb4005/README.md#capturing-console-output).) With this option you can install a virtual console before the document is even created, thus allowing you to catch any virtual console events that occur during initialization. (jeffcarp)

## 5.2.0

* Implemented much of the [`ParentNode`](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-parentnode) mixin (Joris-van-der-Wel):
  - Moved `children` from `Node` to `ParentNode`, i.e., made it available on `Document`, `DocumentFragment`, and `Element`, but not other types of nodes.
  - Made `children` a `HTMLCollection` instead of a `NodeList`.
  - Implemented `firstElementChild`, `lastElementChild`, and `childElementCount`.
* Implemented the `outerHTML` setter. (Joris-van-der-Wel)
* Fixed the `outerHTML` getter for `<select>` and `<form>`. (Joris-van-der-Wel)
* Fixed various issues with window-less documents, so that they no longer give incorrect results or blow up in strange ways. You can create such documents with e.g. `document.implementation.createHTMLDocument()`. (Joris-van-der-Wel)
* Fixed relative stylesheet resolution when using `@import`. (dbo)

## 5.1.0

* Added support for the `NodeIterator` class from the DOM Standard. (Joris-van-der-Wel)
* Fixed an issue with the initial request where it was not sharing its cookie jar with the subsequent requests, sometimes leading to a "possible EventEmitter memory leak detected" warning. (inikulin)
* Updated tough-cookie to 0.13.0, bringing along many spec compliance fixes. (inikulin)
* Added a fast failure in Node.js™ with a clear error message, so that people don't get confused by syntax errors.

## 5.0.1

* Fixed `document.cookie` setter to no longer ignore `null`; instead it correctly sets a cookie of `"null"`. (Chrome is not compliant to the spec in this regard.)
* Fixed documents created with `parsingMode: "xml"` to no longer get `"<html><head></head><body></body></html>"` automatically inserted when calling `jsdom.jsdom()` with no arguments.
* Fixed the `innerHTML` setter to no longer ignore `undefined`; instead it correctly sets the innerHTML to `"undefined"`.
* Fixed `document.write` to throw for XML documents as per the spec.
* Fixed `document.write` to accept more than one argument (they get concatenated).
* Fixed `document.write("")` to no longer try to write `"<html><head></head><body></body></html>"`.

## 5.0.0

This release overhauls how cookies are handled in jsdom to be less fiddly and more like-a-browser. The work for this was done by [@inikulin](https://github.com/inikulin), who is also our beloved parse5 maintainer.

You should only need to worry about upgrading to this release if you use jsdom's cookie handling capabilities beyond the basics of reading and writing to `document.cookie`. If that describes you, here's what changed:

* Removed `options.jar` and `options.document.cookieDomain` from the configuration for creating jsdom documents.
* Instead, there is now a new option, `options.cookieJar`, which accepts cookie jars created by the new `jsdom.createCookieJar()` API. You should use this if you intend to share cookie jars among multiple jsdom documents.
* Within a given cookie jar, cookie access is now automatically handled on a domain basis, as the browser does, with the domain calculated from the document's URL (supplied as `options.url` when creating a document). This supplants the former `options.document.cookieDomain`.

In addition to these changes to the public API, the following new cookie-related features came along for the ride:

* Implemented automatic cookie-jar sharing with descendant `<iframe>`s. (So, if the iframe is same-domain, it can automatically access the appropriate cookies.)
* Let `options.document.cookie` accept arrays, instead of just strings, for if you want to set multiple cookies at once.

Finally, it's worth noting that we now delegate our cookie handling in general to the [tough-cookie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tough-cookie) package, which should hopefully mean that it now captures many of the behaviors that were previously missing (for example [#1027](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/1027)). @inikulin is working on [a large pull request to fix tough-cookie to be more spec compliant](https://github.com/goinstant/tough-cookie/pull/30), which should automatically be picked up by jsdom installs once it is merged.

## 4.5.1

* Removed unnecessary browserify dependency that was erroneously included in 4.5.0.

## 4.5.0

* Added `document.currentScript`. (jeffcarp)

## 4.4.0

* All resources are now loaded with the [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) package, which means that e.g. GZIPped resources will be properly uncompressed, redirects will be followed, and more. This was previously the case only for URLs passed directly to `jsdom.env`, and not for sub-resources inside the resulting page. (ssesha)

## 4.3.0

* Made the click behavior for radio buttons and checkboxes work when doing `el.dispatchEvent(clickEvent)`, not just when doing `el.click()`. (brandon-bethke-neudesic)
* Added `defaultPrevented` property to `Event` instances, reflecting whether `ev.preventDefault()` has been called. (brandon-bethke-neudesic)
* Moved the `click()` method from `HTMLInputElement.prototype` to `HTMLElement.prototype`, per the latest spec.
* Made the `click()` method trigger a `MouseEvent` instead of just an `Event`.

## 4.2.0

* Added a second parameter to `UIEvent`, `MouseEvent`, and `MutationEvent`, which for now just behaves the same as that for `Event`. (Rich-Harris)

## 4.1.0

* Added a second parameter to the `Event` constructor, which allows you to set the `bubbles` and `cancelable` properties. (brandon-bethke-neudesic)

## 4.0.5

* Added `HTMLUnknownElement` and fix the parser/`document.createElement` to create those instead of `HTMLElement` for unknown elements.
* Fixed issues with named and indexed properties on `window`, as well as `window.length`, with regard to `<frame>`s/`<iframe>`s being added and removed from the document.

_Note:_ this probably should have been a minor version number increment (i.e. 4.1.0 instead of 4.0.5), since it added `HTMLUnknownElement`. We apologize for the deviation from semver.

## 4.0.4

* Fixed parsing of doctypes by relying on the information provided by the html parser if possible.

## 4.0.3

* Fixed events fired from `EventTarget`s to execute their handlers in FIFO order, as per the spec.
* Fixed a case where `childNodes` would not be correctly up to date in some cases. (medikoo)
* Sped up window creation with `jsdom.env` by ~600%, for the special case when no scripts are to be executed.

## 4.0.2

* `EventTarget` is now correctly in the prototype chain of `Window`.
* `EventTarget` argument validation is now correct according to the DOM Standard.
* `DOMException` now behaves more like it should per Web IDL. In particular it has a more comprehensive set of constants, and instances now have `name` properties.
* `new Event("click")` can now be dispatched. (lovebear)
* `document.createEvent` now behaves more like it should according to the DOM Standard: it accepts a wider range of arguments, but will throw if an invalid one is given. (lovebear)
* Fixed a regression in our browser support that required Chrome 41 as of 4.0.1; now Chrome 40 will work, as well as (in theory, although less well-tested) the latest stable versions of Firefox and IE.

## 4.0.1

* Fixed: `Node.prototype.contains` to always return a boolean. This was a regression in 3.1.1. (Joris-van-der-Wel)
* Fixed: `Document.prototype` no longer contains its own `ownerDocument` getter, instead correctly delegating to `Node.prototype`.
* Fixed: some edge cases regarding running `<script>`s in browserified jsdom.
* A couple fixes from updated dependencies (although you would have gotten these anyway with a fresh install, due to floating version specifiers):
    - csstyle minimum version bumped from 0.2.21 to 0.2.23, fixing handling of `0` when setting numeric CSS properties and parsing of shorthand `font` declarations.
    - parse5 minimum version bumped from 1.3.1 to 1.3.2 to, fixing the parsing of `<form>` elements inside `<template>` elements.

## 4.0.0

This release relies on the newly-overhauled `vm` module of io.js to eliminate the Contextify native module dependency. jsdom should now be much easier to use and install, without requiring a C++ compiler toolchain!

Note that as of this release, jsdom no longer works with Node.js™, and instead requires io.js. You are still welcome to install a release in [the 3.x series](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/tree/3.x) if you are stuck on legacy technology like Node.js™.

In the process of rewriting parts of jsdom to use `vm`, a number of related fixes were made regarding the `Window` object:

* In some cases, state was implicitly shared between `Window` instances—especially parser- and serializer-related state. This is no longer the case, thankfully.
* A number of properties of `Window` were updated for spec compliance: some data properties became accessors, and all methods moved from the prototype to the instance.
* The non-standard `document.parentWindow` was removed, in favor of the standard `document.defaultView`. Our apologies for encouraging use of `parentWindow` in our README, tests, and examples.

## 3.1.2

* Some fixes to the `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` internal helper, which should eliminate the cases where calling e.g. `window.alert` crashes your application.
* Fixed a global variable leak when triggering `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` methods, like `window.location.reload`.
* Fixed the URL resolution algorithm to handle `about:blank` properly on all systems (previously it only worked on Windows). This is especially important since as of 3.0.0 the default URL is `about:blank`.
* Fixed, at least partially, the ability to run `<script>`s inside a browserified jsdom instance. This is done by dynamically rewriting the source code so that global variable references become explicit references to `window.variableName`, so it is not foolproof.

## 3.1.1

* Updated `Node.prototype.isEqualNode` to the algorithm of the DOM Standard, fixing a bug where it would throw an error along the way.
* Removed `Node.prototype.isSameNode`, which is not present in the DOM Standard (and was just a verbose `===` check anyway).
* Fixed a couple small issues while browserifying, mainly around `jsdom.env`. However, while doing so discovered that `<script>`s in general don't work too well in a browserified jsdom; see [#1023](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/1023).

## 3.1.0

* Added support for [custom external resource loading](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom#custom-external-resource-loader). (tobie)

## 3.0.3

* Fixed some stray byte-order marks in a couple files, which incidentally [break Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/1095). (sterpe)

## 3.0.2

* Fixed another edge case where unchecking a radio button would incorrectly uncheck radio buttons outside the containing form. (zpao)

## 3.0.1

* Fixed errors when serializing text nodes (possibly only occurred when inside `<template>`).
* Handle null bytes being passed to `jsdom.env`'s autodetecting capabilities. (fluffybunnies)
* Handle empty HTML strings being passed to `jsdom.env`'s `html` option. (fluffybunnies)

## 3.0.0

This release updates large swathes of the DOM APIs to conform to the standard, mostly by removing old stuff. It also fixes a few bugs, introduces a couple new features, and changes some defaults.

3.0.x will be the last release of jsdom to support Node.js. All future releases (starting with 4.0.0) will require [io.js](https://iojs.org/), whose [new `vm` module](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/v1.x/CHANGELOG.md#vm) will allow us to remove our contextify native-module dependency. (Given that I submitted the relevant patch to joyent/node [1.5 years ago](https://github.com/joyent/node/commit/7afdba6e0bc3b69c2bf5fdbd59f938ac8f7a64c5), I'm very excited that we can finally use it!)

* By default documents now use `about:blank` as their URL, instead of trying to infer some type of file URL from the call site (in Node.js) or using `location.href` (in browsers).
* Introduced a new "virtual console" abstraction for capturing console output from inside the page. [See the readme for more information.](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom#capturing-console-output) Note that `console.error` will no longer contribute to the (non-standard, and likely dying in the future) `window.errors` array. (jeffcarp)
* Added the named `new Image(width, height)` constructor. (vinothkr)
* Fixed an exception when using `querySelector` with selectors like `div:last-child > span[title]`.
* Removed all traces of entities, entity types, notations, default attributes, and CDATA sections.
* Differentiated between XML and HTML documents better, for example in how they handle the casing of tag names and attributes.
* Updated `DOMImplementation` to mostly work per-spec, including removing `addFeature` and `removeFeature` methods, the `ownerDocument` property, and making `hasFeature` always return `true`.
* Re-did the `CharacterData` implementation to follow the algorithms in the DOM Standard; this notably removes a few exceptions that were previously thrown.
* Re-did `Comment`, `Text`, and `ProcessingInstruction` to follow the DOM Standard and derive from `CharacterData`.
* Re-did `DocumentType` to follow the DOM Standard and be much simpler, notably removing notations, entities, and default attributes.
* Fixed a variety of accessors on `Node`, `Element`, `Attr`, and `Document`; some were removed that were nonstandard (especially setters); others were updated to reflect the spec; etc.
* Re-did name/qname validation, which is done by various APIs, to work with the xml-name-validator package and some centralized algorithms.
* Made the XML parser at least somewhat aware of processing instructions.
* Cleaned up doctype parsing and association between doctypes and documents. More exotic doctypes should parse better now.
* `document.contentType` now is generally inferred from the parsing mode of the document.
* Moved some properties to `Document.prototype` and `Window.prototype` instead of setting them as own properties during the document/window creation. This should improve memory usage (as well as spec compliance).

## 2.0.0

This release is largely a refactoring r
