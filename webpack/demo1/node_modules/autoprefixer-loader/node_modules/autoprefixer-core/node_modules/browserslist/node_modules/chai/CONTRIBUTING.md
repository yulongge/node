# Chai Contribution Guidelines

We like to encourage you to contribute to the Chai.js repository. This should be as easy as possible for you but there are a few things to consider when contributing. The following guidelines for contribution should be followed if you want to submit a pull request or open an issue.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.

## TLDR;

- Creating an Issue or Pull Request requires a [GitHub](http://github.com) account.
- Issue reports should be **clear**, **concise** and **reproducible**. Check to see if your issue has already been resolved in the [master]() branch or already reported in Chai's [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/issues).
- Pull Requests must adhere to strict [coding style guidelines](https://github.com/chaijs/chai/wiki/Chai-Coding-Style-Guide).
- In general, avoid submitting PRs for new Assertions without asking core contributors first. More than likely it would be better implemented as a plugin.
- Additional support is available via the [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/chaijs) or on irc.freenode.net#chaijs.
- **IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to license your work under the same license as that used by the project.
