.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Philosophy
.P
Markdown is intended to be as easy\-to\-read and easy\-to\-write as is feasible\.
.P
Readability, however, is emphasized above all else\. A Markdown\-formatted
.br
document should be publishable as\-is, as plain text, without looking
.br
like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions\. While
.br
Markdown's syntax has been influenced by several existing text\-to\-HTML
.br
filters \-\- including Setext \fIhttp://docutils\.sourceforge\.net/mirror/setext\.html\fR, atx \fIhttp://www\.aaronsw\.com/2002/atx/\fR, Textile \fIhttp://textism\.com/tools/textile/\fR, reStructuredText \fIhttp://docutils\.sourceforge\.net/rst\.html\fR,
.br
Grutatext \fIhttp://www\.triptico\.com/software/grutatxt\.html\fR, and EtText \fIhttp://ettext\.taint\.org/doc/\fR \-\- the single biggest source of
.br
inspiration for Markdown's syntax is the format of plain text email\.
.P
To this end, Markdown's syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation
.br
characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so
.br
as to look like what they mean\. E\.g\., asterisks around a word actually
.br
look like *emphasis*\|\. Markdown lists look like, well, lists\. Even
.br
blockquotes look like quoted passages of text, assuming you've ever
.br
used email\.
.SS Inline HTML
.P
Markdown's syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a
.br
format for \fIwriting\fR for the web\.
.P
Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it\. Its
.br
syntax is very small, corresponding only to a very small subset of
.br
HTML tags\. The idea is \fInot\fR to create a syntax that makes it easier
.br
to insert HTML tags\. In my opinion, HTML tags are already easy to
.br
insert\. The idea for Markdown is to make it easy to read, write, and
.br
edit prose\. HTML is a \fIpublishing\fR format; Markdown is a \fIwriting\fR
.br
format\. Thus, Markdown's formatting syntax only addresses issues that
.br
can be conveyed in plain text\.
.P
For any markup that is not covered by Markdown's syntax, you simply
.br
use HTML itself\. There's no need to preface it or delimit it to
.br
indicate that you're switching from Markdown to HTML; you just use
.br
the tags\.
.P
The only restrictions are that block\-level HTML elements \-\- e\.g\. \fB<div>\fP,
.br
\fB<table>\fP, \fB<pre>\fP, \fB<p>\fP, etc\. \-\- must be separated from surrounding
.br
content by blank lines, and the start and end tags of the block should
.br
not be indented with tabs or spaces\. Markdown is smart enough not
.br
to add extra (unwanted) \fB<p>\fP tags around HTML block\-level tags\.
.P
For example, to add an HTML table to a Markdown article:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
This is a regular paragraph\.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Foo</td>
    </tr>
</table>

This is another regular paragraph\.
.fi
.RE
.P
Note that Markdown formatting syntax is not processed within block\-level
.br
HTML tags\. E\.g\., you can't use Markdown\-style \fB*emphasis*\fP inside an
.br
HTML block\.
.P
Span\-level HTML tags \-\- e\.g\. \fB<span>\fP, \fB<cite>\fP, or \fB<del>\fP \-\- can be
.br
used anywhere in a Markdown paragraph, list item, or header\. If you
.br
want, you can even use HTML tags instead of Markdown formatting; e\.g\. if
.br
you'd prefer to use HTML \fB<a>\fP or \fB<img>\fP tags instead of Markdown's
.br
link or image syntax, go right ahead\.
.P
Unlike block\-level HTML tags, Markdown syntax \fIis\fR processed within
.br
span\-level tags\.
.SS Automatic Escaping for Special Characters
.P
In HTML, there are two characters that demand special treatment: \fB<\fP
.br
and \fB&\fP\|\. Left angle brackets are used to start tags; ampersands are
.br
used to denote HTML entities\. If you want to use them as literal
.br
characters, you must escape them as entities, e\.g\. \fB&lt;\fP, and
.br
\fB&\fP\|\.
.P
Ampersands in particular are bedeviling for web writers\. If you want to
.br
write about 'AT&T', you need to write '\fBAT&T\fP\|'\. You even need to
.br
escape ampersands within URLs\. Thus, if you want to link to:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
http://images\.google\.com/images?num=30&q=larry+bird
.fi
.RE
.P
you need to encode the URL as:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
http://images\.google\.com/images?num=30&q=larry+bird
.fi
.RE
.P
in your anchor tag \fBhref\fP attribute\. Needless to say, this is easy to
.br
forget, and is probably the single most common source of HTML validation
.br
errors in otherwise well\-marked\-up web sites\.
.P
Markdown allows you to use these characters naturally, taking care of
.br
all the necessary escaping for you\. If you use an ampersand as part of
.br
an HTML entity, it remains unchanged; otherwise it will be translated
.br
into \fB&\fP\|\.
.P
So, if you want to include a copyright symbol in your article, you can write:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
\(co
.fi
.RE
.P
and Markdown will leave it alone\. But if you write:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
AT&T
.fi
.RE
.P
Markdown will translate it to:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
AT&T
.fi
.RE
.P
Similarly, because Markdown supports inline HTML \fI#html\fR, if you use
.br
angle brackets as delimiters for HTML tags, Markdown will treat them as
.br
such\. But if you write:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
4 < 5
.fi
.RE
.P
Markdown will translate it to:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
4 &lt; 5
.fi
.RE
.P
However, inside Markdown code spans and blocks, angle brackets and
.br
ampersands are \fIalways\fR encoded automatically\. This makes it easy to use
.br
Markdown to write about HTML code\. (As opposed to raw HTML, which is a
.br
terrible format for writing about HTML syntax, because every single \fB<\fP
.br
and \fB&\fP in your example code needs to be escaped\.)
.SH BLOCK ELEMENTS
.SS Paragraphs and Line Breaks
.P
A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated
.br
by one or more blank lines\. (A blank line is any line that looks like a
.br
blank line \-\- a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered
.br
blank\.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs\.
.P
The implication of the "one or more consecutive lines of text" rule is
.br
that Markdown supports "hard\-wrapped" text paragraphs\. This differs
.br
significantly from most other text\-to\-HTML formatters (including Movable
.br
Type's "Convert Line Breaks" option) which translate every line break
.br
character in a paragraph into a \fB<br />\fP tag\.
.P
When you \fIdo\fR want to insert a \fB<br />\fP break tag using Markdown, you
.br
end a line with two or more spaces, then type return\.
.P
Yes, this takes a tad more effort to create a \fB<br />\fP, but a simplistic
.br
"every line break is a \fB<br />\fP" rule wouldn't work for Markdown\.
.br
Markdown's email\-style blockquoting \fI#blockquote\fR and multi\-paragraph list items \fI#list\fR
.br
work best \-\- and look better \-\- when you format them with hard breaks\.
.SS Headers
.P
Markdown supports two styles of headers, Setext \fIhttp://docutils\.sourceforge\.net/mirror/setext\.html\fR and atx \fIhttp://www\.aaronsw\.com/2002/atx/\fR\|\.
.P
Setext\-style headers are "underlined" using equal signs (for first\-level
.br
headers) and dashes (for second\-level headers)\. For example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
This is an H1
=============

This is an H2
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
.fi
.RE
.P
Any number of underlining \fB=\fP\|'s or \fB\-\fP\|'s will work\.
.P
Atx\-style headers use 1\-6 hash characters at the start of the line,
.br
corresponding to header levels 1\-6\. For example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
# This is an H1

## This is an H2

###### This is an H6
.fi
.RE
.P
Optionally, you may "close" atx\-style headers\. This is purely
.br
cosmetic \-\- you can use this if you think it looks better\. The
.br
closing hashes don't even need to match the number of hashes
.br
used to open the header\. (The number of opening hashes
.br
determines the header level\.) :
.P
.RS 2
.nf
# This is an H1 #

## This is an H2 ##

### This is an H3 ######
.fi
.RE
.SS Blockquotes
.P
Markdown uses email\-style \fB>\fP characters for blockquoting\. If you're
.br
familiar with quoting passages of text in an email message, then you
.br
know how to create a blockquote in Markdown\. It looks best if you hard
.br
wrap the text and put a \fB>\fP before every line:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs\. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
> consectetuer adipiscing elit\. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus\.
> Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus\.
>
> Donec sit amet nisl\. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit\. Suspendisse
> id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing\.
.fi
.RE
.P
Markdown allows you to be lazy and only put the \fB>\fP before the first
.br
line of a hard\-wrapped paragraph:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs\. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetuer adipiscing elit\. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus\.
Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus\.

> Donec sit amet nisl\. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit\. Suspendisse
id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing\.
.fi
.RE
.P
Blockquotes can be nested (i\.e\. a blockquote\-in\-a\-blockquote) by
.br
adding additional levels of \fB>\fP:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
> This is the first level of quoting\.
>
> > This is nested blockquote\.
>
> Back to the first level\.
.fi
.RE
.P
Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists,
.br
and code blocks:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
> ## This is a header\.
>
> 1\.   This is the first list item\.
> 2\.   This is the second list item\.
>
> Here's some example code:
>
>     return shell_exec("echo $input | $markdown_script");
.fi
.RE
.P
Any decent text editor should make email\-style quoting easy\. For
.br
example, with BBEdit, you can make a selection and choose Increase
.br
Quote Level from the Text menu\.
.SS Lists
.P
Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists\.
.P
Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens \-\- interchangably
.br
\-\- as list markers:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
*   Red
*   Green
*   Blue
.fi
.RE
.P
is equivalent to:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
+   Red
+   Green
+   Blue
.fi
.RE
.P
and:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
\-   Red
\-   Green
\-   Blue
.fi
.RE
.P
Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
1\.  Bird
2\.  McHale
3\.  Parish
.fi
.RE
.P
It's important to note that the actual numbers you use to mark the
.br
list have no effect on the HTML output Markdown produces\. The HTML
.br
Markdown produces from the above list is:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
<ol>
<li>Bird</li>
<li>McHale</li>
<li>Parish</li>
</ol>
